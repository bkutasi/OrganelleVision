# OrganelleVision

## Overview
OrganelleVision is a specialized software toolkit for automating transmission electron microscopy (TEM) workflow, specifically designed for organelle identification and analysis. This project focuses on the automated detection and analysis of cellular organelles, with particular emphasis on mitochondria and vesicles in rodent ileum tissue samples.
